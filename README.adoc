# VueJS starter

## Base

so the base for this project is the ASP.NET Core vue SPA template that ships with 2.0 of ASP.NET core.

## Why

Basically digging around and tweaking things, found a bunch of things that could be improved in general. Should help
future me when I want to build an actual web UI. A few of the things 

. Upgraded to latest Vue(2.3.2 -> 2.4.2) and Typescript (2.3 -> 2.4)
. Got rid of `awesome-typescript-loader` and got back `ts-loader` which lets you import .vue components easily.
. Added examples of simple components, slots and vuex.
. Added examples of bundling components into chunks - Vue Async Component + webpack's code splitting feature.
. Removed .vue.html extension and named back to .vue - works better with the vetur plugin under VS Code.
