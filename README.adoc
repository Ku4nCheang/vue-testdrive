# VueJS starter

## Base

so the base for this project is the ASP.NET Core vue SPA template that ships
with 2.0 of ASP.NET core.

## Why

Basically digging around and tweaking things, found a bunch of things that
could be improved in general. Should help future me when I want to build an
actual web UI. A few of the things 

. Upgraded to latest Vue(2.3.2 -> 2.4.2) and Typescript (2.3 -> 2.4)
. Got rid of `awesome-typescript-loader` and got back `ts-loader` which lets
you import .vue components easily.
. Added examples of simple components,
https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Named-Slots[slots] and
https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/intro.html[vuex].
. Added examples of bundling components into chunks -
https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Async-Components[Vue Async
Component] + https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/[webpack's code
splitting] feature.
. Hooked in babel-loader in webpack - so ts transpilation path is 
`TS ---ts-loader---> ES2015 ----babel-loader--> ES5`. This lets us use the dynamic 
import statement in TS 2.4 for defining async components.
. Removed .vue.html extension and named back to .vue - works better with the
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur[vetur] plugin
under VS Code.
