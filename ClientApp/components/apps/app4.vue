    <h1>Component events</h1>
    <p> This example is of a parent component which has a list of items that are rendered in a loop with child components.
        When set active is pressed on the child, it publishes an event which the parent listens to and updates it's active
        data element. 
    </p>
    <p> This example also illustrates loading component on demand from the server - in this case the child component is 
        retrieved from the server on demand when it is rendered and then cached
